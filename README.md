# b-challenge-android demo app
## Overview
Follows clean architecture guidelines (presentation, domain, data) with
MVVM architectural design pattern.
Although it's not necessary to follow these in such a small app,
the purpose of the implementation was to demonstrate knowledge of such architectural guidelines/patterns

## Features used
- Material3 (Light theme and dark theme to be implemented)
- Jetpack Compose
- Retrofit2
- Dagger + Hilt
- Coroutines Flow

## Improvements which could be done
- Complete material theme which follows Material3 guidelines (typography and colours)
- Use of string resources
- Styling defaults.
- Further Responsiveness on tablet devices.
- Combine Similar compsable screens which are similar (in the case such screens are used more, it would be worth a refactor)
- Handle process death
- Also colour pallete not perfect

## Bonus
Also bonus broccoli illustration and gif by yours truly (yes it's janky, but it's fun!)  :)

## Video Demo, Keep in mind screen after cancel invite alert is not in video, although in the current repo.
